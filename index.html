                  I am Nguyen Thanh Tuan, a member of the TAQ team and a current student at RMIT University Vietnam. My student number is 3836455. I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh city. In 2014, I travelled to the United States of America for higher education. However, things didn't go as planned so I came back and applied to RMIT University Vietnam to continue my studies. I am majoring in Information Technology. I actually studied Business for a while when I was living in the States. During that time, my host family sparkled the love of IT in me when he taught and guided me through the process of building my own computer. After my first build, I decided to officially switch my major to IT and dig deeper into it. I figured out that I am really into Networking, Cyber Security, and Database/Server. Although I don’t have a lot of experience in the IT field beside some knowledge about computers, and codings, I am eager to learn more and make a career out of it, or even a business. During my free time, I love to hang out with friends; it can be anything from getting a cup of coffee, travelling with our bikes, or even playing video games together.

                  My name is Ky Anh, member of the TAQ team, first year student of RMIT in Saigon campus and my major is IT. Therefore, I was studying International Business at Hanoi campus. When finishing the first semester, I found out that business doesn't suit me well so I changed the course. Having known that I had interest in technologies and the Internet, I decided to move to Saigon campus without hesitation. In the Information Technology area, things that attract me the most are Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Technologies. Furthermore, when seeing these things, the first thought in my mind is “what features does it have and what can it do?”. I always wanted to try new technologies not with speech from the others but by my own hands, because by interacting directly with these technologies I can easily memorize their features and how to manipulate them. Nevertheless, besides the love for technologies, I also have some IT experience when I have not graduated from my high school. At this time, the school itself has organized a science fair at the school hall. This fair includes all students from different ages to participate, by forming in a group of 5 members and creating an invention of their own, this could be anything but most students chose to make a robot instead. Therefore, our group has invented a robot that can pick up items by using a controller but unfortunately it only can move around but cannot pick up items nearby.

                <p class="text-center">
                    Hi , My name is Quynh but you can also call me Lam, I am a freshman at RMIT and my student ID is s3836322. I am the third member of the TAQ team. So let's talk a little bit about myself. Firstly, I was born on a very--very special day, which is Women's National Day. Sadly, I just have one gift on this day. Secondly, as you can see in my name, I was born in Vietnam. However, I can speak English too thanks to my parents because they made me learn English at a very young age. Thirdly, there is one fun fact about me : my brother and also my cousins used to call me “Quan”, which means trouser in Vietnamese, because my name has a similar pronunciation. Moreover, in my free time, I love reading books and learning new things in different aspects such as marketing, business, etc. If you ask what my interest in IT is, it is definitely AI. I have a huge passion for AI because I am a lazy person and with the help of AI, my work will be completely faster and more efficient. To make my dream come true, I have studied some courses relevant to AI and machine learning on LinkedLearn. Moreover, I have attended many classes to learn about algorithms and data structure. Furthermore, to expand my knowledge in this field, I have read many books relevant to to AI, machine learning and data

        <p class="grid-item2">
            <b style="font-size:15px;">16Personalities Test - Mediator:</b><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading through the analysis of the Mediator personality type, I start to understand more about myself and the traits and connections of my personality with others. These traits can both positively and negatively affect the efficiency of our group’s project.
            Firstly, I truly believe in harmony, and this trait is mentioned a lot in the analysis. I do not like conflict and prefer a mutual agreement on everything. As a harmony “guardian”, it is my job to keep the group friendly, comfortable, and connected. I can help dealing with conflicts and easing the tension whenever it may happen. On the other hand, this means that I can sometimes take these conflicts or problems too personally, which may cause me to hold back and slow down the group’s progress.
            Another important trait is the need of connection with the work that I am doing. As a Mediator, it is important for me to have a good connection with my work, both emotionally and morally. Mediators only show their true potentials when they truly believe and love the things that they do. However, it is also a critical point to the group if I am not into the project I am doing with them. It may negatively affect the outcome of the project and the connection with other group members.<br /><br />
            <b>Learning Style Test - Visual:</b><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the results from the test shows, I am 50% Visual, 35% Auditory, and 15% Tactile. This means that it is easier and faster for me to learn something by looking. As I am “attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.” , it is important for me to write down keywords, brainstorm, take note and color code my work. In other words, to make the most out of my work in our group’s project, it is best for me to visualize things as I need to see things to learn it well.<br /><br />
            <b>Creativity Test - 67.13:</b><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My score for the creativity test is 67.13, which is slightly higher than a typical person in every field. In my opinion, this means that I am not likely to have an ‘out-of-the-box’ idea that can ‘revolutionize’ our group project. However, I do believe that there are a lot of variables that can affect one’s creativity/imagination, for example, one’s knowledge of the subject. So, it is hard to say that I will not be able to contribute much in terms of creativity.

        <!--Anh opinion-->
        <p class="grid-item2">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When forming in a group, these results from three tests will be a huge support for me when finding a group for myself. In these results, for example the Creativity test, I have a low in Persistence and Boldness. Therefore, I have a problem with pushing myself forward when doing projects and afraid that the group projects will receive a low grade because of my contribution. Moreover, I rarely express my thoughts to others which results in my members unable to support me. So when forming a group I have to express my thoughts more, ask for others if I do not understand what my task is so they can support me and push me forward.

       <!--Quynh's opinion-->
       <p class="grid-item2">
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t understand myself quite well so these results of personality tests have a big meaning to me. It helps me to acknowledge myself and improve my weakness. In the “16 Persionality test”, according to the result, it shows my strength and weakness. Thanks to the test, I can know what I am good at and make beneficials from that. In the second test about “Learning style”, this test is important because it helps me to understand which is the best method to study effectively. Finally the third test, which is “Creativity test”, shows me what I am lacking and as a result of it, I know how to improve myself.Overall,  all these tests are very helpful information to our group because each member can know each other's strengths and weaknesses. As a result of that, we can support what skills the others are lacking and learn new things from each other to develop not only technical skills such as knowledge about programming but also soft skills such as how to work in a team or how to speak in front of people.

                <h3 class="text-center text-h1" style="font-size:25px;">Ideal jobs’ analysis</h3>
                <p class="text-center">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the job description, our group’s ideal jobs focus on 3 different segments of IT - Database, Hardware/Software, and AI. Tuan’s ideal job - Database Administrator, in general, involves “designing, implementing, managing and maintaining company’s databases”. Anh’s ideal job - System Developer focuses on managing, maintaining, and troubleshooting company’s systems like accounts, call centers, and others. On the other hand, Quynh’s ideal job - AI/Data Mining Developer requires her to “perform functional analysis, application design, development, unit test, deployment and maintenance”. Despite the differences, our group believes that data is the common element between Tuan and Quynh’s jobs. <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data is involved heavily in both Tuan and Quynh’s jobs. As a Database Administrator, Tuan has to work a lot with data since it is his job to keep the company’s database performing sufficiently to “ensure the availability and consistent performance of our corporate applications”
                    . On the other hand, as a AI/Data Mining Developer, Quynh needs the data to perform her tasks as data is important for AI to train test units or models. In other words, Tuan keeps the database functional for Quynh, so she can use the data for her AI’s tasks.<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, one could say that Tuan and Anh’s jobs have a common background. Since both Tuan (Database Administrator) and Anh (System Developer) are required to maintain, improve and troubleshoot the system they are assigned to; they are, technically, doing the same job but in different segments of IT, with different focuses.

                <p class="text-center">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Tuan, with his interest in Networking, Database, and Cyber Security, within the next 5 years, he plans to study on his own thoroughly most of the coding languages for those fields like C, C++, Java, Python, and so on. He also plans to intern at relevant companies to strengthen his skills and experiences. If possible, he also wants to get his Master’s degree right after he graduates from RMIT. After that, he would love to work for around 5 years with some self-study of general business/finance to prepare for the next big step. His biggest goal, at this moment, is to start up a cloud/server/database solution company with his best friend who is majoring in Finance and Logistics. <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Anh, he does not have a clear career plan for himself yet. At the moment, he wants to strengthen his coding skills with Java, Python, HTML, and CSS within the next 5 years. He also wants to study Linux and Windows Server. On the other hand, he plans to also study some business courses to improve his skills in finance. <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Quynh sets her goals to be an expert in the field of AI/Machine Learning. She plans to apply for an internship during her second year of internship to gain more experiences. She is also in the progress of self-study of AI, Machine Learning, and AWS on LinkedLearn. She wants to gain enough knowledge and experiences to start researching furthermore on the topic of AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning with a focus on some topics like facial recognition/detection, AI chat bot, and so on. <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up the analysis for our group’s career plans, each of us has our own plans and paths for the future. At the present, since our group’s members are still in our first or second year in college, it is certain that we still have a lot to learn and experience to prepare for whatever we plan in the future, at least for the next 2 to 3 years. After this period, it is when the difference starts to kick in. For Anh, he isn’t sure about what he wants to do next, after his college life. For Tuan, he wants to start up a company with his friend that provides cloud/server/database solutions for others; while, on the other hand, Quynh wants to go deeper into the field of AI/Machine Learning.

Our team decided to use colloration ways. At first, our leader - Tuan created the repository for our group on Github and then invite others members to this repository so they can edit and pull the code.<br /><br />
                                                         At first we did the code on our computer and then combined it to one file. Then, we choosed one day which is the day near deadline to push the code together.  Therefore, it would reduce the mistakes and errors during the process of pulling the code to Github

I choose Database Administrator because I want to learn and improve my skill set in this field so I can prepare for my database/server solution startup in the future. So, the data from Burning Glass Data did not affect my choice at the moment. However, it is good for me to keep it in mind so that I can predict the trend and prepare carefully for my startup.</div>

           According to Burning Glass data, although my job is not in great demand, I still insist on my ideal job because of these reasons. Firstly, if I work with Data, I can do anything within the fields from healthcare to business since data is everywhere and everything needs data. Secondly, the salary. Although this job is not great in demand, the salary ranges from $72,000 to $158,000 per year according to Glass Door.
           Finally, I have a huge passion for data so I will not change my mind and go with this job.

                <h4 class="text-center" style="margin-top:5px">Interview with Professor Tran Ngoc Quang!</h4><br />

                <p style="margin-top:-1px;">
                    Mr. Tran Ngoc Quang is currently one of the IT professors at RMIT University Vietnam. He shared with us that he has been working in the field of education for the last 15 years, specifically in IT major classes. Although he works as an IT professor, it is hard to classify him as an IT professional. However, he also shared that he worked as Software Engineer for about 2 years in the US. The content of these question will only focus on the time when he worked as an IT professional.
                </p>

                <!--The question 1-->
                <b>1. What kind of work is done by the IT professional ?</b><br />
                <p>
                    As a Software Engineer, his main job was to write software products. He said that the first step was to design the software. Then, he wrote the code, implement it, and do some simple test of the software. After that, the software got delivered to the tester for further testing. When the results came back, he would then check if there were any bugs or issues with the software and proceeded to fix them. He mentioned that he only did a small part of the main system and contributed them to the team.

                </p><br />

                <!--The question 2-->
                <b>2. What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with ? Are they other IT professionals ? Clients ? Investors ? The general public ?</b><br />
                <p>
                    During his time as a Software Engineer, despite the stereotype about IT people that they only sit at their desks and work alone, he had to interact and communicate with a lot of people. Like many other Software Engineers, he did not finish the product on his own. There was a team of several people who worked together to finish the product. Besides communicating with other team members to plan and finish the project, he and his teammates had to follow the company’s guidelines to avoid confusions and errors. He also interacted with testers about the possible bugs and errors in the code. He shared with us that he did not communicate with the clients about the requirements and needs for the software, all this information was documented and delivered to him and his team through Product Managers and Business Analysts.
                </p><br />

                <!--The question 3-->
                <b>3. Where do the IT professionals spend most of their time ?</b><br />
                <p>
                    Professor Tran Ngoc Quang shared that he spent 60 to 70 percent of his time designing and writing the code for the software. During the designing phase, he had to figure out the functions and features for the software, in other words, the requirements of the software and its uses. During the programming phase, he then proceeded to write his part, contribute it to the team’s work, and do some simple testing. He also shared that 80% of the people who work in the IT industry are good at coding and most of the IT jobs require some sort of programming and coding. So, it is safe to say that IT professionals, in general, spend most of their time designing and programming.

                    For him, it was important to understand the functions and features he needed to deliver. Because, failing to do so resulted in bad programs, unused features, and time-wasting. However, he and his team did not communicate directly with the customers/clients. Product Managers and Business Analysts were responsible to document, deliver presentations and explain to his team about what his team needed to do. From there, he and his team could build the software. There were times that what the clients came up with was not efficient or fitted into the system, he had to discuss and suggest a better alternative to maximize the software to avoid bad programming.

                                        Just like traditional Virtual Private Networking (VPN), Virtual Dispersive Networking (VDN) provides a more secure network with online anonymity and others features like bypassing geographical filter and so on. The biggest difference of VDN compared to VPN, in terms of security, is its ability to tackle the problem of the Man-in-the-Middle attack. According to Jason Bloomberg (Forbes), the core idea of VDN was based mainly on the technique of military radio communication called spread-spectrum security [1]. “By spreading the signal over a larger frequency band”, “this makes the signal more difficult to distinguish from noise and therefore more difficult to jam or intercept.” [2]. On the other hand, in terms of cyber security, when the VDN is deployed (for example, in an end-to-end network), the messages/packages from the sending device are split up into “several different simultaneous parts”. These parts are then encrypted and sent to the receiving device through multiple paths and nodes. When the encrypted parts reach its destination, they can only be decrypted and reassembled by the receiving device [1]. By splitting and spreading the message over multiple paths and nodes of the virtual network, this practice makes it harder for hackers, who utilize the Man-in-the-Middle attack, to gain useful data/information since the collected data is not only encrypted, but also just a small part of the actual message/package.

                                            Virtual Dispersive Networking (VDN) is invented by Robert W. Twitchell, Jr. It is already patented and under the ownership of Dispersive Networks, Inc. Since there is no public research on improving VDN from both the inventor and the patent owner, but rather on its applications, it is safe to say that VDN is currently at its state-of-the-art form. Based on the website of Dispersive Networks, Inc., one of the main focuses of the company is its cyber security concept named SASE, which stands for Secure Access Service Edge. SASE, according to the company, is developed based on the convergence of Network-as-a-service and Security-as-a-service with the intention to unify and simplify the two services [3]. The VDN technology is used to power SASE as one of its key features, especially in terms of security. Other projects with VDN from Dispersive Networks, Inc., that are worth mentioning, are the partnership with ClearBlade to “accelerate and secure IoT edge and cloud deployments” in July, 2020 [4] and the partnership with Envistacom to improve and enhance the U.S. government and military networks’ security in February 2020 [5].

The main idea of this white paper focuses on the benefits when combining blockchain (“decentralized data management and integrity capabilities”) and virtual networks like VDN (“highly secure, resilient, and fast”), and how they can actually be fused together [6]. Following up with this white paper, ClearBlade also joined this partnership and the four companies have established a project called Blockchain Network Fusion. With the rise of blockchain adoption in the last few years and the partnership of these four global leaders, it is safe to say that the combination of Blockchain and VDN will transform how data and data sharing works in the near future [7].

The receiving end will decrypt and unify these pieces to reform the message. Another technology, that is worth mentioning, is Virtual Private Networking (VPN). In my opinion, VDN is, technically, an improved version of VPN. The main difference between the two networking methods is how their data is being transferred in the virtual networks, single-path (VPN) vs multi-path (VDN).

                                            Since the VDN technology is still new and without actual deployment for us to analyze, compare, and contrast its actual efficiencies in the field, let us assume that the VDN works perfectly as advertised. In my opinion, there is at least one potential impact of this development. The speed of data transfer and how it works will be significantly improved. According to Dispersive Networks, Inc., as the data is split up and sent across different routes (multi-path) with the ability to switch to “a new unimpeded path” if there is an occurrence of congestions or attacks, this helps increasing the speed of our data transfer and assuring the delivery of the data to its destination [8]. With the development of VDN, transferring a large amount of data (for example, Big Data) over the Internet can now be much faster [1].

                                            There is no doubt that hackers, especially who utilizes the man-in-the-middle attacks, are one of those affect by the development of VDN. But, if we dig a bit deeper into it, VDN can make VPN redundant in the future. As I mentioned in the first section, VDN can, somewhat, be understood as an improved version of VPN with better speed and security features. According to a demonstration video from Dispersive Networks, Inc., VDN provides a faster, more reliable, and stable connectivity when compared to the traditional VPN [8]. However, one could make an argument that VDN cannot make VPN become obsolete anytime soon. According to Jason Bloomberg (Forbes), the scope VDN technology focuses mainly on the improvement of government/military networks or big companies like banks, rather than VPN providers or end-users [1]. But, in my opinion, there is still a good chance that VPN will be slowly replaced by the newer and better VDN technology if it becomes mainstreamed and commercialized for end-users.

                                        At the current state of the VDN technology, I believe that it has no obvious effect on my daily life. Since the focus of Dispersive Networks, Inc., the company which owns the VDN technology, is towards government, military, and big companies, there will not be any direct effects on normal citizens like me. However, let me imagine that VDN had become more recognizable and adopted by many current VPN providers. As a person who has friends around the world, I often spend my free time playing online video games with them. However, due to the latency of the connection from my computer to the game servers in other places like US, the game is almost unplayable, and it is hard for me to enjoy the game to the fullest. With the assistance of VPN, the connection improves a little bit but still not enough. But, with the new VDN technology, it might be a completely different story as the data is transferred in pieces through multi paths and routes to compensate for the latency of a single-path connection.

                                        Since Quynh, a member of our TAQ Team, has a huge interest in Machine Learning and AI, the ability to have fast and reliable accesses to data is extremely important to her. With the development of VDN, it provides a huge advantage to the field of Machine Learning and AI as data across different database, servers and locations can be accessed much faster with better security features. Another friend of mine, named Raquel, works as an IT specialist for Washington State Department of Ecology. Her job is to manage the administration system and the database of the State Department. We had a little talk about VDN, and she said that if this technology performed as intended, it would be a great addition to the current system at her company. However, legacy systems can be a big problem when deploying VDN into the real world since the switch can be extremely expensive. Regardless of that, it is a promising development to consider.

The interest in Blockchain technology has been increasing since the idea was coined in 2008. The reason for the interest in Blockchain is its central attributes that provide security, anonymity and data integrity without any third party organization in control of the transactions, and therefore it creates interesting research areas, especially from the perspective of technical challenges and limitations”. Therefore, currency transactions are often controlled and centralized by third party organizations. Thus, currency transfers and digital payments require intermediaries such as banks or credit cards to make transactions. Additionally, a fee is caused when making a transaction from these intermediaries. This process also applied in some domains namely Games, Music, Software and more. Rather than allowing two principal entities whose making transaction to control their data and information, in fact this was in charge by the third party. To solve this issue, blockchain technology has been developed. The purpose of blockchain technology is creating a decentralized environment where there are no third parties involved.

The state of art of blockchain technology is EOS, a new blockchain protocol. According to EOS creator Dan Larimer, the purpose of this new development is to provide a secure and transparent system. Furthermore, EOS also offers a management system for both local and global monetary transactions. Moreover, EOS is actually a decentralized platform, its main purpose is to develop and support the ability to build decentralized applications.

Therefore, using blockchain technology could reduce the medical costs, secure the information about critical health issues in the world, secure the patients data and medical sensitive data. Additionally, blockchain is treated as a distributed ledger to store healthcare or related data for exchanging, sharing, analyzing, recording and validating among stakeholders [2]. Furthermore, beside healthcare applications, the Health Information Exchange or healthcare transactions between patients, providers, and other relevant parties is also the most discussed. These recorded data are described in the Improved medical record management, Enhanced insurance claim process, and Accelerated clinical/biomedical research sections.[3]</p>

These transportation use ad-hoc networks for vehicle communication which namely Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC), Wireless Access Vehicular Environment (WACE), and cellular network. Therefore, these ad-hoc networks do not guarantee a secure data transmission.[3] In fact, the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) is based on cellular and IT standards mechanisms, which therefore are not up-to-date and can be harmful for the system.</p>

                                                                         <p>In the future, these IVs will be fully autonomous, by using dynamic blockchain (LDB) and main blockchain, enabled with a secure and unique crypto ID called intelligent vehicle trust point (IVTP). The IVTP provides trustworthiness among vehicles. Vehicles then use and verify the IVTP with the LDB to communicate with other vehicles.[4]</p>

Depending on the types of the product, the supply chain can contain many phases, multiple geographical locations, several individuals, entities, accounts and payments, and means of transport. By applying blockchain technology in the supply chain processes could improve its sustainability. Blockchain can enhance the efficiency and transparency of the supply chain and affects all supply processes, delivery and payments. In addition, tracking goods through blockchain can improve the decision-making process with the end result being a more satisfying service for the end user.[5]</p>

The most potential impact of blockchain is data storage and management. Therefore, the original recorded data were publicly online so people can read, observe and even change it. When the recorded data has been changed through several processes, it becomes unreliable. Some data even was stolen and re-edited with a different owner. By using blockchain technology, the data then is decentralized and secure. The owner can stamp their published date and name on a block in a blockchains, in addition, the data when uploaded to a block are being decentralized and cannot be changed or copied. Therefore, the most affected people are the stakeholders, companies or any organizations because it will change the way they are used to store and protect the data. This development will not replace, create or make redundant any of the current jobs. The only thing that will change is the technologies used to store the data and software that provides protection to these data.</p>

Seeing our data being secured, the less nervous we are.</p>

Unlike physical money, which is used in real life, cryptocurrency is usually used for transferring purposes, bought or sold items between parties over the Internet and its values were determined by the market. Cryptocurrency also can be used to purchase products or services, along with making payments to other things on the Internet. The current state of the art of cryptocurrency is EOS.IO, a modern cryptocurrency which was introduced in 2017. </p>

                                                                             With a stable development, cryptocurrency would be a revolution in economics all over the world, as well as the marketplace. The result of this is because cryptocurrency is a type of currency made from immaterial from the digital world which has been encrypted by blockchain technology. As we have known, every country has their own currencies, and if another type of currency exists in their systems, there will be an economic crisis. So that is why economics is the most potential impact of cryptocurrency. Therefore, if we want to avoid an economic crisis, the new cryptocurrency must be acknowledged worldwide and be used for exchange purposes. Besides potential impact, cryptocurrency can replace the term “Type of currency”. If a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin was used widely by all society, there will be a high chance that the current currency will be replaced completely, making it become the only currency that exists.
                                                                             With the rise of cryptocurrency, the type of person that easily gets attracted to this digital money is investors, especially young investors, or middle age. Unlike senior one, these two types usually seek for potential things that are worth investing in and cryptocurrency is one of them. The developing stage of cryptocurrency is significantly high, the money you get compared to the first time you invest in will be doubled or sometimes tripled if that cryptocurrency is successful in attracting people. For example, 1 Bitcoin now worth 266,509,023 VND. With that huge amount of money, no investor could resist it, especially for young people who are seeking for success.
                                                                             Furthermore, if cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin become a new currency unit in the world, the first thing will be replaced and wiped out is money-printing machine, and materials such as polymer and wood would no longer be needed for printing out the currency. With the extinction of the money-printing machine, therefore the person who is in charge of this machine will also be fired. Instead, people who have graduated Computer Science and received it qualification will be recruited, because cryptocurrency like Bitcoin can not be achieved freely but instead you have to solve encrypted puzzles provided by Bitcoin software in order to achieve those coins. This process needs a lot of electricity and technical expertise.

This result in many countries is still underdeveloped, and many of them have not got access to the term ‘Cryptocurrency’ yet. For my daily life, physical currency is still the typical currency which is used day by day, people still use physical currency to exchange, sell and buy things and as time goes by, it has become a part of our life, the most thing we get used to. But in the future, things might go different as cryptocurrency would replace the entire currency system. Therefore, we usually bring with us a wallet and phone, but in the future the only thing you brought with us is just your phone or a crypto card for payments purposes. There will be no longer thieves that stole your belongings and if they do, they must encrypt your card to use your money, but that for the future. Furthermore, I do not need to go to the supermarket, mega mall or grocery stores to buy things, instead what I need is to lay back on the couch and press a button, all the items will be paid and ready to deliver. Life would be more modern, easier, and simpler for me. For young people like myself and my friends, it would be less difficult for us to get familiar with the term ‘cryptocurrency’, though we might see each other often and discuss it together, but for the elders and my parents it will be more difficult from knowing “what is it ?” to “how to use it efficiently”. Moreover, because they have been using physical currency for a long time, it will take time to explain for them and sometimes a family member will not know how to use electric devices as well.</p>

Therefore, the decisions made will be faster than the well trained driver. Self driving car will make the road safer and prevent injuries[16]. Moreover, this can boost our productivity by searching for the fastest way to go to the destination or helping us to find the parking car easier[16]. As a result of it, it will cut down our fuel consumption which will save us a lot of money. The most people who will be affected by this technology could be drivers. Customers can not put their trust on the whom they just meet at the moment since many crimes have occurred on this vehicle. Therefore, if the self-driving are legally permitted to ride on the road, they may switch to use it and the numbers of drivers will be cut down which leads to unemployment.</p></dd>

Although machine learning is efficient and creates the bigger change in the manufacture , it will not replace an entire career. Machine learning just can do some of the tasks required in a job. According to “What machine learning can do and can not do ?” by Irving Wladawsky-Berger, just some of the tasks in the occupation are suitable for using machine learning, while others require social skills, judgement and other human capabilities[14]. </p>

Firstly, virtual personal assistant which is applied speech recognition, converting text to speech or speech to text and  Natural Language Processing is a must-have tool in your life since it helps me, my family and my friends reduce the time of doing tasks and it also is a great help for someone who is lack of capability such as illiteracy or disability. My dad frequently calls his co-workers when he drives the car which is not safe if he was driving the car at the same time as picking up the phone. Therefore, with the great help of Siri, he just has to say “Hey siri, call Tom” and the virtual assistant then looks in the contact data and makes the phone call. Another example is my grandmother, because of her ability, it is very difficult for her to use the phone to call somebody. However, with the slice of speech, she now can easily call my family without taking time to find where the phone icon is. Secondly, Google Translate, this application is applied to machine learning techniques such as Natural Language Process, POS Tagging, Chunking and NER and nobody can deny the greatest benefits that it brings to us. I use Google Translate as it is my daily routine, from translating it to read books to learning how to pronounce the word. This helps me a lot since it is not time consuming and it is free. Back in the days I did not discover this great tool, I bought a dictionary which just contained one language and it did not support the pronunciation. Moreover, when I want to look up the word, I have to search it in the alphabet order which takes me a lot of time to do so. However, compared to Google Translate, I can learn whatever language I want to, learn how to speak easily and search words very fast. My family uses mainly this for work such as translating the contract and speaking to foreigners. Overall, there are more applications using machine learning that affect us in different aspects.</p></li></dd>

Instead of that, I just have to enter the location I want to go and sleep until it reaches the destination. Moreover, it will help my father a lot since he has to work anywhere, anytime especially on the car. He has to make contact with his co-worker while driving the car which is not safe. However, with the help of self - driving cars, my father can work in the car and also guarantee safety. </p></li></dd>

            My project would be a web application called CodeX that could help users in Vietnam learn how to code and program. This application will provide many walkthrough tutorials to learn different programming languages such as C++, Java, Python,etc. Moreover, at the end of each session, to know if the users understand what they have learned, CodeX will provide several quizzes to help users remember the course easier.
            Besides that, it will have many mentors available for you to ask how to start coding, which is the best language for you to learn. Moreover, you can match with somebody that starts the same program path as you. Therefore, you can learn something new from others and tell them about what you have learned, because one of the best ways to learn something is teaching it to somebody else. If you finish our tutorials, there are many challenges or pet projects to do as practice makes perfect.

        <p class="grid-item2">
            We are now standing on the brick of four industrial revolutions.Therefore, the demand of computer and information technology has been currently increasing. According to VietNam’s News, Viet Nam needs more than 400,000 information technology (IT) in 2020 and this number will become greater for the next 10 years. Not all Vietnamese people have the chance to study English so learning through video tutorials or reading documents is quite hard for them to understand especially for the young. This application will be the essential tool for their start of exploring the IT world. Moreover, for those who want to change their career path to IT or lost basic knowledge about IT, CodeX provides many courses which take 3-4 hours to help them keep back on track.

This feature not only helps users to apply what they have learned but also to know their ability. Therefore, they can modify the study plan to develop themselves. Furthermore, the best thing about joining the competition is that users can expand their net-working. They will know more people and learn new things from others.

There is going to be a range of job recruitments from web developers, game developers,full stack,etc which depend on what users’ career path are. Moreover, CodeX also provides the feature “Job near you” so it will make users easy to search things. This not only provides jobs in Vietnam, if developers want to have an opportunity to work overseas, there will be jobs available for them too.

        <p class="grid-item2">
            Software : This application will be developed using HTML, CSS and Javascript to build a web application. Beside, to store the data of the customers or the service itself, it would also be used MongoDB or SQL and PHP. Moreover, for creating the online interpreter, I can use the API of the third service such as <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/api/docs">Hackkerank</a> or <a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/docs/wiki/developers/legacy/">HackerEarth</a>. <br /> <br />
            Hardware: To store thousand of thousand data, there would be lots of hard disk. Beside from that, to provide better experiment for the customers , it should have a good RAM since it have a lot of feature which may slow down the application

            <strong>Hard-working</strong> : I think this is the most important skill to be an IT employee. If I don’t have this skill, the project will be procrastinated and never be done. Therefore, the project may be fail <br /><br />
            <strong>Patient</strong>: Beside the hard-working, there I should be patient too because I have to work under a lot of pressure which may decrease my motivation toward the project. Being patient can get me overcome it and get back on what I started <br /><br />
            <strong>Technical in HTML, CSS, Javascript, MongoDB and some other programming languages </strong>: Those languages are the main core if I want to build up CodeX. As a result of it, without that skill, I can not do anything.

        <!--Outcome-->
        <h2 class="image-center" style="width:70%"><span style="font-family: 'Baloo Tamma 2', cursive;">Outcome</span></h2>
        <p class="grid-item2">
            If CodeX is successful, there might be more and more people working in the IT industry which meet the requirement of this career for the next 10 years. Therefore, the IT industry in Vietnam will be developed and reached to the position that could be compared to other developed countries such as China, America, Russia, etc. Consequently, robots for housework which helps saving time, self-driving cars which are very useful for those who do not know to drive cars, virtual assistants like Jarvis in Marvel movies to arrange your work,.. those things in the next 5 years might be common in Vietnam. Finally, with those services made in Vietnam, it can be bought from other countries which can bring benefits for Vietnam’s economic efficiency.
