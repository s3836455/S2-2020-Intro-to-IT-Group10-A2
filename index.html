                  I am Nguyen Thanh Tuan, a member of the TAQ team and a current student at RMIT University Vietnam. My student number is 3836455. I was born and raised in Ho Chi Minh city. In 2014, I travelled to the United States of America for higher education. However, things didn't go as planned so I came back and applied to RMIT University Vietnam to continue my studies. I am majoring in Information Technology. I actually studied Business for a while when I was living in the States. During that time, my host family sparkled the love of IT in me when he taught and guided me through the process of building my own computer. After my first build, I decided to officially switch my major to IT and dig deeper into it. I figured out that I am really into Networking, Cyber Security, and Database/Server. Although I don’t have a lot of experience in the IT field beside some knowledge about computers, and codings, I am eager to learn more and make a career out of it, or even a business. During my free time, I love to hang out with friends; it can be anything from getting a cup of coffee, travelling with our bikes, or even playing video games together.

                  My name is Ky Anh, member of the TAQ team, first year student of RMIT in Saigon campus and my major is IT. Therefore, I was studying International Business at Hanoi campus. When finishing the first semester, I found out that business doesn't suit me well so I changed the course. Having known that I had interest in technologies and the Internet, I decided to move to Saigon campus without hesitation. In the Information Technology area, things that attract me the most are Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Technologies. Furthermore, when seeing these things, the first thought in my mind is “what features does it have and what can it do?”. I always wanted to try new technologies not with speech from the others but by my own hands, because by interacting directly with these technologies I can easily memorize their features and how to manipulate them. Nevertheless, besides the love for technologies, I also have some IT experience when I have not graduated from my high school. At this time, the school itself has organized a science fair at the school hall. This fair includes all students from different ages to participate, by forming in a group of 5 members and creating an invention of their own, this could be anything but most students chose to make a robot instead. Therefore, our group has invented a robot that can pick up items by using a controller but unfortunately it only can move around but cannot pick up items nearby.

                <p class="text-center">
                    Hi , My name is Quynh but you can also call me Lam, I am a freshman at RMIT and my student ID is s3836322. I am the third member of the TAQ team. So let's talk a little bit about myself. Firstly, I was born on a very--very special day, which is Women's National Day. Sadly, I just have one gift on this day. Secondly, as you can see in my name, I was born in Vietnam. However, I can speak English too thanks to my parents because they made me learn English at a very young age. Thirdly, there is one fun fact about me : my brother and also my cousins used to call me “Quan”, which means trouser in Vietnamese, because my name has a similar pronunciation. Moreover, in my free time, I love reading books and learning new things in different aspects such as marketing, business, etc. If you ask what my interest in IT is, it is definitely AI. I have a huge passion for AI because I am a lazy person and with the help of AI, my work will be completely faster and more efficient. To make my dream come true, I have studied some courses relevant to AI and machine learning on LinkedLearn. Moreover, I have attended many classes to learn about algorithms and data structure. Furthermore, to expand my knowledge in this field, I have read many books relevant to to AI, machine learning and data

        <p class="grid-item2">
            <b style="font-size:15px;">16Personalities Test - Mediator:</b><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After reading through the analysis of the Mediator personality type, I start to understand more about myself and the traits and connections of my personality with others. These traits can both positively and negatively affect the efficiency of our group’s project.
            Firstly, I truly believe in harmony, and this trait is mentioned a lot in the analysis. I do not like conflict and prefer a mutual agreement on everything. As a harmony “guardian”, it is my job to keep the group friendly, comfortable, and connected. I can help dealing with conflicts and easing the tension whenever it may happen. On the other hand, this means that I can sometimes take these conflicts or problems too personally, which may cause me to hold back and slow down the group’s progress.
            Another important trait is the need of connection with the work that I am doing. As a Mediator, it is important for me to have a good connection with my work, both emotionally and morally. Mediators only show their true potentials when they truly believe and love the things that they do. However, it is also a critical point to the group if I am not into the project I am doing with them. It may negatively affect the outcome of the project and the connection with other group members.<br /><br />
            <b>Learning Style Test - Visual:</b><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the results from the test shows, I am 50% Visual, 35% Auditory, and 15% Tactile. This means that it is easier and faster for me to learn something by looking. As I am “attracted to color and to spoken language (like stories) that is rich in imagery.” , it is important for me to write down keywords, brainstorm, take note and color code my work. In other words, to make the most out of my work in our group’s project, it is best for me to visualize things as I need to see things to learn it well.<br /><br />
            <b>Creativity Test - 67.13:</b><br />
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My score for the creativity test is 67.13, which is slightly higher than a typical person in every field. In my opinion, this means that I am not likely to have an ‘out-of-the-box’ idea that can ‘revolutionize’ our group project. However, I do believe that there are a lot of variables that can affect one’s creativity/imagination, for example, one’s knowledge of the subject. So, it is hard to say that I will not be able to contribute much in terms of creativity.

        <!--Anh opinion-->
        <p class="grid-item2">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When forming in a group, these results from three tests will be a huge support for me when finding a group for myself. In these results, for example the Creativity test, I have a low in Persistence and Boldness. Therefore, I have a problem with pushing myself forward when doing projects and afraid that the group projects will receive a low grade because of my contribution. Moreover, I rarely express my thoughts to others which results in my members unable to support me. So when forming a group I have to express my thoughts more, ask for others if I do not understand what my task is so they can support me and push me forward.

       <!--Quynh's opinion-->
       <p class="grid-item2">
           &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t understand myself quite well so these results of personality tests have a big meaning to me. It helps me to acknowledge myself and improve my weakness. In the “16 Persionality test”, according to the result, it shows my strength and weakness. Thanks to the test, I can know what I am good at and make beneficials from that. In the second test about “Learning style”, this test is important because it helps me to understand which is the best method to study effectively. Finally the third test, which is “Creativity test”, shows me what I am lacking and as a result of it, I know how to improve myself.Overall,  all these tests are very helpful information to our group because each member can know each other's strengths and weaknesses. As a result of that, we can support what skills the others are lacking and learn new things from each other to develop not only technical skills such as knowledge about programming but also soft skills such as how to work in a team or how to speak in front of people.

                <h3 class="text-center text-h1" style="font-size:25px;">Ideal jobs’ analysis</h3>
                <p class="text-center">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the job description, our group’s ideal jobs focus on 3 different segments of IT - Database, Hardware/Software, and AI. Tuan’s ideal job - Database Administrator, in general, involves “designing, implementing, managing and maintaining company’s databases”. Anh’s ideal job - System Developer focuses on managing, maintaining, and troubleshooting company’s systems like accounts, call centers, and others. On the other hand, Quynh’s ideal job - AI/Data Mining Developer requires her to “perform functional analysis, application design, development, unit test, deployment and maintenance”. Despite the differences, our group believes that data is the common element between Tuan and Quynh’s jobs. <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data is involved heavily in both Tuan and Quynh’s jobs. As a Database Administrator, Tuan has to work a lot with data since it is his job to keep the company’s database performing sufficiently to “ensure the availability and consistent performance of our corporate applications”
                    . On the other hand, as a AI/Data Mining Developer, Quynh needs the data to perform her tasks as data is important for AI to train test units or models. In other words, Tuan keeps the database functional for Quynh, so she can use the data for her AI’s tasks.<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, one could say that Tuan and Anh’s jobs have a common background. Since both Tuan (Database Administrator) and Anh (System Developer) are required to maintain, improve and troubleshoot the system they are assigned to; they are, technically, doing the same job but in different segments of IT, with different focuses.

                <p class="text-center">
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Tuan, with his interest in Networking, Database, and Cyber Security, within the next 5 years, he plans to study on his own thoroughly most of the coding languages for those fields like C, C++, Java, Python, and so on. He also plans to intern at relevant companies to strengthen his skills and experiences. If possible, he also wants to get his Master’s degree right after he graduates from RMIT. After that, he would love to work for around 5 years with some self-study of general business/finance to prepare for the next big step. His biggest goal, at this moment, is to start up a cloud/server/database solution company with his best friend who is majoring in Finance and Logistics. <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Anh, he does not have a clear career plan for himself yet. At the moment, he wants to strengthen his coding skills with Java, Python, HTML, and CSS within the next 5 years. He also wants to study Linux and Windows Server. On the other hand, he plans to also study some business courses to improve his skills in finance. <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, Quynh sets her goals to be an expert in the field of AI/Machine Learning. She plans to apply for an internship during her second year of internship to gain more experiences. She is also in the progress of self-study of AI, Machine Learning, and AWS on LinkedLearn. She wants to gain enough knowledge and experiences to start researching furthermore on the topic of AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning with a focus on some topics like facial recognition/detection, AI chat bot, and so on. <br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sum up the analysis for our group’s career plans, each of us has our own plans and paths for the future. At the present, since our group’s members are still in our first or second year in college, it is certain that we still have a lot to learn and experience to prepare for whatever we plan in the future, at least for the next 2 to 3 years. After this period, it is when the difference starts to kick in. For Anh, he isn’t sure about what he wants to do next, after his college life. For Tuan, he wants to start up a company with his friend that provides cloud/server/database solutions for others; while, on the other hand, Quynh wants to go deeper into the field of AI/Machine Learning.

                                                         In the tutorial, we have learn 2 ways push code on Github which is using collboration or using fork ways. Our team decided to use colloration ways. At first, our leader - Tuan created the repository for our group on Github and then invite others members to this repository so they can edit and pull the code.<br /><br />
                                                         At first we did the code on our computer and then combined it to one file. Then, we choosed one day which is the day near deadline to push the code together.  Therefore, it would reduce the mistakes and errors during the process of pulling the code to Github
                                                     </p>

                        <li>All the commit messsages are written in great detail so others member could know which part had been done and which part had not<br /><br /></li>
                        <li>While looking at the history of the repository, the date we push all code was quite closed to each other because we planned to push our code in one day together to reduce errors and mistakes while pushing it to Github<br /><br /></li>

            <div class="grid-item2">After checking the Burning Glass Data, I realise that my ideal job is not in the top spots in terms of demand from employers. As my interest for IT varies between Database/Server, Networking, and Cyber Security, I can, in fact, choose a higher-ranking job like Network Engineer. I choose Database Administrator because I want to learn and improve my skill set in this field so I can prepare for my database/server solution startup in the future. So, the data from Burning Glass Data did not affect my choice at the moment. However, it is good for me to keep it in mind so that I can predict the trend and prepare carefully for my startup.</div>
